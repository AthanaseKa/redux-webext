This package allows you to use [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for managing the state of your WebExtension.

## Installation

`npm install redux-webext --save`

## Introduction

Usually WebExtension consists of two basic parts:
 
* _background page_, where you store the data and process it somehow
* _UI pages_ (e.g. popup or content scripts), where you show the data from _background page_

As you can see, to provide data between _background_ and _UI_ pages you have to use [messages](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging). Or... actually, you don't have to, because of `redux-webext`:

In a nutshell, `redux-webext` takes care of communication between _background_ and _UI_ pages using Redux. But there are 2 key things that you should understand:

* In _background_ page there is Redux store that contains the entire state of your WebExtension. All logic (actions, reducers etc) is placed in _background_ page as well.
* _UI_ pages have access to the state via their own Redux stores, but **there are no real actions or reducers**. I said *real* because _UI_ pages might have functions associated with actions in _background_ page. You can think about it like a proxy that allows you to call _background_ actions from _UI_ pages.

Now let's consider the situations when the state can be changed:

* Something happened in _background_ page. In this case we just call an action as usual in Redux, reducers return a new state and `redux-webext` notifies all stores (_background_ and _UI_ ones) in your WebExtension.
* User interaction in _UI_ page (e.g. user click on a button in popup). Firstly, in _UI_ page we call a function associated with a *real* action in _background_ page. Then `redux-webext` calls the _real_ action and afterwards everything works as in the previous case.

Also there's [tutorial with example](https://github.com/ivantsov/redux-webext/tree/master/examples) where you can find how to use `redux-ext`.

## API

#### `createBackgroundStore(options)` - creates Redux store for _background_ page.

#### Options

- `store` - instance of Redux store.
- `actions` (optional) - object with `background` actions that will be provided to `ui` components.
- `onDisconnect` (optional) - function that will be called on destroying `ui` store (e.g. right after closing a popup).

Returns the provided `store`.

#### `createUIStore()` - creates Redux store for _ui_ pages.

Returns `promise` which will be resolved after receiving the current state of `background` store. And an object with identical to Redux store structure will be passed as resolved result.
